# MODLOG: Risk of Bonk

## Design (agreed with the user)
- Host: Risk of Rain 2 (primary, BepInEx 5). Megabonk is a required companion, read from the player's own install.
- Online co-op is RoR2's own (up to 4 players).
- Full vision: Megabonk movement/physics controls, Megabonk characters with RoR2 movesets, Megabonk hordes and upgrade
  system, the Megabonk boss event at the Teleporter, Megabonk final bosses instead of Mithrix and the others, endless
  looping, Megabonk-style menus, a Bonk style (random terrain) / Rain style (RoR2 stages) toggle, and all shrines,
  chests and runes from both games.
- v1 scope picked by the user: **characters + menus first**.

## Route
- RoR2: BepInEx 5 plugin + HarmonyX, with no R2API dependency (content pack, prefab cloning, network ids and tokens done directly).
- Megabonk: Unity IL2CPP. Its built-in Unity assets are read with AssetsTools.NET plus classdata.tpk at runtime; no
  code is loaded.
- Models are auto-rigged onto the moveset survivor's bones at runtime (nearest bone segment, 2 weights).

## Versions
- Compiled against RiskOfRain2.GameLibs 1.3.1.275-r.0 (nuget.org) and UnityEngine.Modules 2021.3.33.
  The bepinex.dev feed (newer GameLibs) is blocked from the build container. The members the mod uses are older stable
  APIs; SkinDef fields are set through reflection because newer builds moved them into SkinDefParams.
- BepInEx 5.4.23.2 (reference only). AssetsTools.NET 3.0.5. classdata.tpk from UABEA v8.

## Status
- Builds: yes (`./build.sh`). Preflight: 0 errors, 21 unverified cells (Megabonk asset names + logo).
- NOT run in game yet: the build container has neither game. The first run on a PC with both games must:
  1. check `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` for "Megabonk survivors ready: ..." and any warnings;
  2. read `BepInEx/RiskOfBonk/megabonk_inventory.txt`, fix `mbNameHints` in sheets/characters.json and set
     `mbAssetsVerified: true` per row;
  3. check each character's facing (`yawOffsetDeg`) and fit in the character select.
- Melty: melty.gg is denied by this cloud environment's network policy, so nothing is uploaded or listed yet.
